abstract:  
  This edited book focuses on the circular economy perspective, which involves designing everything to be reused as long as possible and repurposed when reuse is no longer possible. The book adopts a biomimetic lens and discusses the need for cross-industry flows and different actors beyond producers and consumers in circular value cycles. The book covers the spectrum of recovery possibilities to return products back to the consumption supply chain, and the essential role of information management. It aims to move beyond a dyadic view and embrace a holistic network or ecosystem view, considering a cross-industry system perspective where there is a diversity of actors needed for a working ecosystem.

## Introducción

The transition to a circular economy, which is based on principles of designing out waste and pollution, is challenging for US companies due to products that are difficult to disassemble. However, it is a sustainable and flexible way to grow without exhausting primary materials. Waste is reduced by closed-loop recycling and reuse, going beyond traditional recycling methods. The EU has created a finance support platform for circular economy projects, directing billions of euros towards these projects. The circular economy also involves a shift in product ownership to purchasing a service and a financial model of leasing rather than ownership. Collaboration within the circular framework is important, and networks of industries can be designed analogous to food webs to reach a sustainable and efficient state.

The book covers the biomimetic roles of producers, consumers, scavengers, and decomposers, and provides insights to transition linear supply chains to circular systems. Current economic systems have an abundance of producers and consumers, resulting in a linear material usage pattern. In contrast, natural ecosystems have a balance between producers, consumers, scavengers, and decomposers. A systemic perspective that embraces cross-industry flows and an expansive spectrum of actors is needed to establish circular value cycles and move beyond limited-scope recycling solutions that result in value degradation and waste.

The current research lacks a systemic perspective that is needed to achieve an integrated management of material and information flows to realize a circular economy with circular value cycles. The biomimetic lens highlights the need for cross-industry flows and additional actors beyond producers and consumers.  This book focuses on bridging the current linear material usage patterns towards circular systems, with a particular emphasis on biomimicry in natural ecosystems.

## Structure Of Overall Book – The Biomimetic Lens
The book aims to provide a comprehensive overview and coverage of actors and preconditions for a circular economy using the biomimetic lens. Chapters are organized according to the respective actor group or needed information infrastructure. The book includes broad early chapters with a system perspective, specific roles of actors, information and financial flows, contextual ramifications, and cases from various industries. Many of the chapters highlight the importance of the roles of scavengers and decomposers in moving towards a circular business ecosystem. Ver imágenes adjuntas de la Tabla 1.2 en el anexo.

## Conclusions
The authors of the book aimed to fill a gap in publications related to circular economy and value systems, using a biomimicry-inspired lens. They were grateful to the authors who contributed to the book. The book is divided into two parts: Chapters 2-13 focus on specific topics related to circular economy systems, while Chapters 14-19 provide practical examples and applications. The book is intended for both research-oriented and practical audiences, with numerous suggestions for future research provided throughout the individual chapters. The case studies may be particularly useful for companies or educational discussions. Overall, the book provides a system perspective on contemporary circular economy thinking and practice.
